# Sales Data Dashboard

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains the source code and resources for creating a Sales Data dashboard using Power BI. The project focuses on ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes performed entirely within Power BI to create an insightful and interactive Sales Data dashboard. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales-related metrics and insights, helping organizations make data-driven decisions.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- **Data**: This directory contains the Sales Data database file(s) used as a data source for the Sales Data dashboard. Make sure to place your Sales Data database file(s) here.

- **Power BI**: This directory contains the Power BI project file (`.pbix`) and any additional resources required for the dashboard.
